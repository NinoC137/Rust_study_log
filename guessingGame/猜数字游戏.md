# Guessing Game by Rust

## Processing the game

``` rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read a line");

    println!("You guessed : {guess}");
}
```

**This code is get a guess from the user then print it.**



To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the `io` input/output library into scope. The `io` library comes from the standard library, known as `std`:

``` rust
use std::io;
```

By default, Rust has a **set** of items defined in standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the *prelude*, and you can see everything in it [in the standard library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a `use` statement. Using the `std::io` library provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept user input.



## Storing Values with Variables

Next, we'll create a *variable* to store the user input, like this:

``` rust
    let mut guess = String::new();
```

**let :** We use the `let` statement to create the variable.

**mut : ** means `mutable`. To make the variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name:

``` rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that `let mut guess` will introduce a mutable variable named `guess`. The equal sign (`=`) tells Rust we want to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is the value that `guess` is bound to, which is the result of calling `String::new`, a function that returns a new instance of a `String`. [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

In full, the `let mut guess = String::new();` line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a `String`. 



## Receiving User Input

We had included the input/output functionally from the standard library with `use std::io;` on the first line. Now we'll call the `stdin` function from the `io` module, which will allow us to handle user input:

``` rust
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
```

If we hadn’t imported the `io` library with `use std::io;` at the beginning of the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as `std::io::stdin`. The `stdin` function returns an instance of [`std::io::Stdin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html), which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.

Next, the line `.read_line(&mut guess)` calls the [`read_line`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line) method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. We’re also passing `&mut guess` as the argument to `read_line` to tell it what string to store the user input in. The full job of `read_line` is to **take** whatever the **user types** into standard input and append that **into a string** (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string’s content.

The `&` indicates that this argument is a *reference*, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data **without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times**. References are a complex feature, and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this program. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are **immutable by default**. So, you need to write `&mut guess` rather than `&guess` to make it **mutable**. 



## Handling Potential Failure with Result.

We can see the third line pf `io::stdin` is:

``` rust
        .expect("Failed to read line");
```

We could have written this code as:

``` rust
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
```

However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. 

As mentioned earlier, **`read_line`** puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it **also returns a `Result` value.** [`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) is an [*enumeration*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html), often called an *enum*, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a *variant*.

**`Result`’s variants are `Ok` and `Err`.** The `Ok` variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside `Ok` is the successfully generated value. The `Err` variant means the operation failed, and `Err` contains information about how or why the operation failed.

An instance of `Result` has an [`expect` method](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect) that you can call. 

​	If this instance of `Result` is an `Err` value, `expect` will **cause the program to crash** and display the message that you passed as an argument to `expect`. **Err call the function: expect()**

​	If this instance of `Result` is an `Ok` value, `expect` will take the return value that `Ok` is holding and **return just that value to you** so you can use it. In this case, **that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input**.

If you don’t call `expect`, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:

```shell
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessinGame)
warning: unused `Result` that must be used
  --> src/main.rs:10:5
   |
10 |     io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled
   = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
help: use `let _ = ...` to ignore the resulting value
   |
10 |     let _ = io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
   |     +++++++

warning: `guessingGame` (bin "guessingGame") generated 1 warning
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
```

Rust warns that you haven’t used the `Result` value returned from `read_line`, indicating that the **program hasn’t handled a possible error**.

**The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code**, but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we can use `expect`.



## Printing Values with println! Placeholders

Aside from the closing curly bracket, there’s only one more line to discuss in the code so far:

```rust
    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
```

This line prints the string that now contains the user’s input. **The `{}` set of curly brackets is a placeholder**: think of `{}` as little crab pincers that hold a value in place. 

Printing a variable and the result of an expression in one call to `println!` would look like this:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```

This code would print `x = 5 and y + 2 = 12`.



## Testing the first part

Run it using `cargo run`

``` shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessingGame v0.1.0 (/home/nino/RustStudy/guessingGame)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
     Running `target/debug/guessingGame`
Guess the number!
Please input your guess.
6
You guessed : 6
```

At this point, the first part of the game is done: we’re getting input from the keyboard and then printing it.



## Generating a secret random number

Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard library. 

However, the Rust team does provide a [`rand` crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand) with said functionality.



### Using a Crate to Get more Functionality

Remember that a crate is **a collection of Rust source code files.** 

**The project we’ve been building** is a *binary crate*, which **is an executable**. 

**The `rand` crate is a *library crate***, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and **can’t be executed on its own.**



Before we can write code that uses `rand`, we need to modify the *Cargo.toml* file to include the `rand` crate as a dependency. 

Filename: Cargo.toml

``` toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project.

``` shell
$ cargo build
   Compiling libc v0.2.155
   Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0
   Compiling ppv-lite86 v0.2.17
   Compiling getrandom v0.2.15
   Compiling rand_core v0.6.4
   Compiling rand_chacha v0.3.1
   Compiling rand v0.8.5
   Compiling guessingGame v0.1.0 (/home/nino/RustStudy/guessingGame)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
```

**The output from running `cargo build` after adding the rand crate as a dependency**

When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the *registry*, which is a copy of data from [Crates.io](https://crates.io/). Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.



### Updating a Crate to Get a New Version

When you *do* want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command `update`, which will ignore the *Cargo.lock* file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in *Cargo.toml*. 

Cargo will then write those versions to the *Cargo.lock* file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the `rand` crate has released the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.9.0, you would see the following if you ran `cargo update`:

```shell
$ cargo update
    Updating crates.io index
    Updating rand v0.8.5 -> v0.8.6
```

Cargo ignores the 0.9.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a change in your *Cargo.lock* file noting that the version of the `rand` crate you are now using is 0.8.6. To use `rand` version 0.9.0 or any version in the 0.9.x series, you’d have to update the *Cargo.toml* file to look like this instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.9.0"
```

The next time you run `cargo build`, Cargo will update the registry of crates available and reevaluate your `rand` requirements according to the new version you have specified.



### Start to generate the random number

Let’s start using `rand` to generate a number to guess. The next step is to update *src/main.rs*, as shown in following.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
}
```

**Adding code to generate a random number**



First we add the line `use rand::Rng;`. **The `Rng` trait** defines methods that random number generators implement, and **this trait must be in scope** for us to use those methods. 

​	In the first line, we call the `rand::thread_rng` function that **gives us the particular random number generator** we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of execution and is seeded by the operating system. 

​	Then we call the `gen_range` method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the `Rng` trait that we brought into scope with the `use rand::Rng;` statement. **The `gen_range` method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the range.** The kind of **range expression** we’re using here takes the form **`start..=end`** and is **inclusive on the lower and upper bounds**, so we need to specify `1..=100` to request a number between 1 and 100.

> **Note:** You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the `cargo doc --open` command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the `rand` crate, for example, run `cargo doc --open` and click `rand` in the sidebar on the left.



### Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them.



Filename: src/main.rs

``` rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read a line");

    println!("You guessed : {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

**这个代码会报错, 报错在于将guess和secret Number进行匹配, 想想为什么(提示: 变量类型)**

First we add another `use` statement, bringing a type called `std::cmp::Ordering` into scope from the standard library. **The `Ordering` type is another enum and has the variants `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`.** These are the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.

The `cmp` method **compares two values and can be called on anything** that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s comparing `guess` to `secret_number`. We use a [`match`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html) expression to decide what to do next **based on which variant of `Ordering` was returned from the call to `cmp`** with the values in `guess` and `secret_number`.



Ultimately, we want to convert the `String` the program reads as input **into a real number type** so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so by adding this line to the `main` function body:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
    // --snip--

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```

The line is:

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

We create a variable named `guess`. But wait, doesn’t the program already have a variable named `guess`? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to **shadow** the previous value of `guess` with a new one. *Shadowing* lets us reuse the `guess` variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as `guess_str` and `guess`, for example. 

> 可以理解为高级版的C/C++强制类型转换, 但是区别在于这里映射出了一个"新"的转换后的变量.

We bind this new variable to the expression `guess.trim().parse()`. 

The `guess` in the expression **refers to** the original `guess` variable that contained the input as a string. 

The `trim` method on a `String` instance will **eliminate any whitespace** at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the string to the `u32`, which can only contain numerical data. 

The user must press enter to satisfy `read_line` and input their guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, **if the user types 5 and presses enter, `guess` looks like this: `5\n`.** The `\n` represents “newline.” (On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, `\r\n`.) **The `trim` method eliminates `\n` or `\r\n`, resulting in just `5`.**

The [`parse` method on strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse) **converts a string to another type.** Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. **We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using `let guess: u32`.** The colon (`:`) after `guess` tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the `u32` seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It’s a good default choice for a small positive number.

The `parse` method will **only work on characters that can logically be converted into numbers** and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string contained `A👍%`, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it might fail, the `parse` method **returns a `Result` type**, so we using the `expect` method again.



Now, let's run the program:

``` shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessingGame v0.1.0 (/home/nino/RustStudy/guessingGame)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s
     Running `target/debug/guessingGame`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 10
Please input your guess.
12
You guessed : 12
Too big!
```

We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess. Let’s change that by adding a loop!



### Allowing Multiple Guesses with looping

The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. We’ll add a loop to give users more chances at guessing the number:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
    // --snip--

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, we’ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into a loop. Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever, which actually introduces a new problem. It doesn’t seem like the user can quit!

The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl-c. But there’s another way to escape this insatiable monster, as mentioned in the `parse` discussion in [“Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number): if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessingGame v0.1.0 (/home/nino/RustStudy/guessingGame)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.15s
     Running `target/debug/guessingGame`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 24
Please input your guess.
24
You guessed : 24
You win!
Please input your guess.
12
You guessed : 12
Too small!
Please input your guess.
26
You guessed : 26
Too big!
Please input your guess.
^C
```

Typing `quit` will quit the game, but as you’ll notice, so will entering any other non-number input. This is suboptimal, to say the least; we want the game to also stop when the correct number is guessed.



### Quitting after a correct guess

Let’s program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a `break` statement:



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Adding the `break` line after `You win!` makes the program exit the loop when the user guesses the secret number correctly. Exiting the loop also means exiting the program, because the loop is the last part of `main`.



### Handling invalid input

To further refine the game’s behavior, rather than crashing the program when the user inputs a non-number, let’s make the game **ignore a non-number** so the user can continue guessing. 

We can do that by altering the line where `guess` is converted from a `String` to a `u32`.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
        // --snip--

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read a line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { //对parse的返回值枚举类型进行match函数匹配
            Ok(num) => num,	//先返回了"OK"变量, 变量内含num值, 接着返回这个num值.
            Err(_) => continue,	//无论Err内部含有什么值, 都直接continue
        };

        println!("You guessed : {guess}");

        // --snip--
```

**Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for another guess instead of crashing the program**



**If `parse` is able to successfully turn the string into a number,** it will return an `Ok` value that contains the resultant number. That `Ok` value will match the first arm’s pattern, and the `match` expression will just return the `num` value that `parse` produced and put inside the `Ok` value. That number will end up right where we want it in the new `guess` variable we’re creating.

**If `parse` is *not* able to turn the string into a number,** it will return an `Err` value that contains more information about the error. The `Err` value does not match the `Ok(num)` pattern in the first `match` arm, but it does match the `Err(_)` pattern in the second arm. **The underscore, `_`, is a catchall value;** in this example, **we’re saying we want to match all `Err` values, no matter what information they have inside them**. So the program will execute the second arm’s code, `continue`, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the `loop` and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the program ignores all errors that `parse` might encounter!



Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let’s try it:

``` shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessingGame v0.1.0 (/home/nino/RustStudy/guessingGame)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/guessingGame`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 56
Please input your guess.
wow
Please input your guess.
number?
Please input your guess.
56
You guessed : 56
You win!
```



## Complete code
