## Êï∞ÊçÆÁ±ªÂûã Data Types

**Every value in Rust is of a certain *data type*,** which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. We‚Äôll look at two data type subsets: **scalar and compound**.

Keep in mind that Rust is a *statically typed* language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a `String` to a numeric type using `parse`, **we must add a type annotation**, like this:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If we don‚Äôt add the `: u32` type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:

```shell
$ cargo build
   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)
error[E0284]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^        ----- type must be known at this point
  |
  = note: cannot satisfy `<_ as FromStr>::Err == _`
help: consider giving `guess` an explicit type
  |
2 |     let guess: /* Type */ = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |              ++++++++++++

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0284`.
error: could not compile `no_type_annotations` (bin "no_type_annotations") due to 1 previous error
```

You‚Äôll see different type annotations for other data types.



You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in following table. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

### Scalar

#### Integer Literals in Rust

| Number literals  | Example       |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to `i32`. The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

> ##### [Integer Overflow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow)
>
> Let‚Äôs say you have a variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as 256, *integer overflow* will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors. When you‚Äôre compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to *panic* at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust uses the term *panicking* when a program exits with an error; we‚Äôll discuss panics in more depth in the [‚ÄúUnrecoverable Errors with `panic!`‚Äù](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html) section in Chapter 9.
>
> When you‚Äôre compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does *not* include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs *two‚Äôs complement wrapping*. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold ‚Äúwrap around‚Äù to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won‚Äôt panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn‚Äôt what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow‚Äôs wrapping behavior is considered an error.
>
> To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:
>
> - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
> - Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
> - Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
> - Saturate at the value‚Äôs minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.



#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

Here‚Äôs an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.



#### Boolean Type

As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if` expression. We‚Äôll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in the [‚ÄúControl Flow‚Äù](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#control-flow) section.



#### Character Type

Rust‚Äôs `char` type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type. Here are some examples of declaring `char` values:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust‚Äôs `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. 



### Compound Types

*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. **Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.**

#### Tuple Type

A *tuple* is a general way of **grouping together** a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. 

Tuples have a **fixed length**: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

every element of a tuple **could have different type**. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

The variable `tup` binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

##### Accessing Tuple elements

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then uses a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called *destructuring* because it breaks the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of `y`, which is `6.4`.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

This program creates the tuple `x` and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, *unit*. This value and its corresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don‚Äôt return any other value.



#### Array Type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an *array*. 

Unlike a tuple, every element of an array **must have the same type**. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data **allocated on the stack** rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in [Chapter 4](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap)) or when you want to ensure you **always have a fixed number of elements**. 

An array isn‚Äôt as flexible as the vector type, though. **A *vector*** is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that **is allowed to grow or shrink in size**. If you‚Äôre unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. [Chapter 8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html) discusses vectors in more detail.

However, **arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change.** 

For example, if you were using the names of the month in a program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it will always contain 12 elements:

```rust
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```

You write an array‚Äôs type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Here, **`i32` is the type of each element**. After the semicolon, **the number `5` indicates the array contains five elements.**

You can also **initialize an array** to contain the same value for each element **by specifying the initial value**, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

The array named **`a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value `3`** initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a more concise way.



##### Accessing Array elements

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

In this example, the variable named `first` will get the value `1` because that is the value at index `[0]` in the array. The variable named `second` will get the value `2` from index `[1]` in the array.

##### Invalid Array Element Access

Let‚Äôs see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:

Filename: src/main.rs

``` rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}
```

This code compiles successfully. 

If you run this code using `cargo run` and enter `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the program will print out the corresponding value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the array, such as `10`, you‚Äôll see output like this:

``` shell
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:19:19:
index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
